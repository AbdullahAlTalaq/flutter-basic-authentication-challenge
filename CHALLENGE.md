### What is Saqal?

Saqal is an open-source organization to guide less experience developers through real-life challenges. Currently, we focus only on Flutter framework.

### Why should I complete Saqal challenges?

Saqal challenges provide unique experience as they’re designed to fill untouched gaps by anyone at anywhere.

- Each challenge has a specific real-life use-case to implement such as basic authentication, OAuth2, file storage, push notification, payment gateways, offline, App security and more to solidify developer’s technical knowledge in different domains.
- Saqal challenges should help you to interact with field experts such as backend engineers, and product owners who will guide you to improve your code and deliverables quality.
- Saqal challenges should help to use real-life tools for communication, documentation and collaboration.
- Saqal challenges should help to follow technical best practices such clean architecture, automation, testing, and documentation.
- Saqal challenges focus on code quality more than nice looking screens.

> Note: Don’t be overwhelmed! It will be covered piece by piece.

### What is the expected outcome?

Saqal challenges hit different important areas from soft skills to proper deployment pipeline. So, expect to learn a lot from each challenge and remember `sky is the limit`.
